Title: User-Centric Design (West Life Experience)

Code Institute project 

Project discription:

The west life experience is a concept sterning from my favourite musical group of all time, 
West Life. This band emanated in the early 2000's and stormed the world, and i 
feel it's only fair if there's a band project i'd give them my time. 
This website basically highlights four essential sections. These being the history section, 
planned tours, video/audio samples and enquiry/contact page of the band. 

*The history section or about gives a brief info about the bands.
*The planned tours section discribes some planned shows the band 
will be embarking. I use bootstrap grid images with the lightbox effect to
convey the required message.
*The media and smaple section will have audio tracks and videos of the band.

Deployment:
After commiting to git with appropriate messages, 
i'll now perform a git push to my GitHub Repo.
<p>The steps:</p>


Testing:

The app has been tested on the ipad, ipad pro, iphone 6 and 7 and they 
resize very well on their screen. Consideration has been given to the text, 
and screen sizes over 600px upwards have a standard font-size of 16px, 
and when they break into lower 600px get font-size of 12px.
The font selected 'Lato' renders perfectly on most browsers, 
including mozilla, safari and chrome, as am yet to test them on IE.9 and above.
A lot of tweeking went into the bootstrap lightbox as they are preset from the 
box with it's own look, a bit of css was needed to get it to my desired taste. 

Animate.js is a small javascript API used to create minimalist effects on elements. 
And so far it works perfectly in all the browsers they've been tried on.

Audio player resizes correctly to all screens tested on and all buttons responds
appropriately.
