Title: User-Centric Design (West Life Experience)

Code Institute project 

Project discription:

The west life experience is a concept sterning from my favourite musical group of all time, 
West Life. This band emanated in the early 2000's and stormed the world, and i 
feel it's only fair if there's a band project i'd give them my time. 
This website basically highlights four essential sections. These being the history section, 
planned tours, video/audio samples and enquiry/contact page of the band. 

*The About section or about gives a brief info about the band.
*The planned tours section discribes some planned shows the band 
will be embarking. I use bootstrap grid images with the lightbox effect to
style the images.
*The media section has the some of the audio tracks  of the band and a framed video from youtube. 





Deployment:
After commiting to git with appropriate messages, 
u'll now perform a git push to my GitHub Repo.
To create a new repository;
1.first assign a repository name.

3.You will either select to initialize your repository with a readme file.(optional)
