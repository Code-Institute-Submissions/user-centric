# User-Centric Project

## A Code Institute Project. User-centric front-end designed web design.

## Getting Started

To start, these are some basic preparations required. A fairly good understanding 
of HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP4 and modern web editor, like brackets or vscode.

    '''The westfest  usercentric project is supposed to be the website designed  as part 
    of the  come back of the world-renowned music group after many years of separation. 
    Westlife has been one of  my favourite music group  and this is one of the reasons 
    I chose them as the theme for my project.'''


## Built With

  [HTML5] 
* [bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Animate.js](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
* [Hover CSS](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
* [CSS3]
* [fontawesone icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free)
* [bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com)
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


    
### Prerequisites:

Start by setting up your html template. Within the <head> tag place your 
title and various links to connect to your HTML. The bootstrap4 css cdn to be used will
be placed in the head tags aswell. It's important to place the script tags at 
the bottom of the page but right before the closing body tags.


## Deployment:

After committing to git with the appropriate messages, 
I'll now perform a git push to my GitHub Repo.
To create a new repository;
* first assign a repository name.
* write a short description of the site to be uploaded.
* You will either select to initialize your repository with a README.md file. (optional)
* create your repository.

## Testing:

The app has been tested on the ipad, ipad pro, iphone 6,7,X,ipad and they 
resize very well on their screen. Consideration has been given to the text rendering aswell. 
The font selected 'Lato' renders perfectly on most browsers, 
including mozilla, safari and chrome, as am yet to test them on IE.9 and above.
A lot of tweeking went into the bootstrap lightbox as they are preset from the 
box with it's own look, a bit of css was needed to get it to my desired taste. 

Animate.js is a small javascript API used to create minimalist effects on elements. 
And so far it works perfectly in all the browsers they've been tried on.

Audio player resizes correctly to all screens tested on and all buttons responds
appropriately.
